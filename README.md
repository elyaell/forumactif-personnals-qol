# Forumactif personnals QOL

All of the little bits of code added on my forumactif forum to upgrade the qol of the forum.

## Annexes Library

An html/CSS/jQuery page that allows for a complex and interactive library of information on the forum.

## Character Sheet Generator

An HTML/CSS/jQuery page that allows a player to directly generate their character sheet in the correct format. This keeps players from having to directly manipulate the code as much as possible.

## Character switch in subject

A HTML/jQuery bit of code that allow a player to use a different avatar/name/rank/group color in the current post of a subjet. Used when the original user leave or the account is reused for another character. Adapted on the `viewtopic_body.tpl` of BlankTheme (https://blank-theme.com/).
