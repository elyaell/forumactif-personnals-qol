## Annexes library

An html/CSS/jQuery page that allows for a complex and interactive library of information on the forum. The aim is to limit the interactions of the editor into the structure, by just adding the news elements and the rest should be automatically updated. The editor still need to follows some rules to assure the update will be correctly integrated.

### How to use in FA

Create a HTML page in FA, with the style.css content inside `<style></style>` and app.js content inside `<script type="text/javascript"></script>`.

You can redirect directly onto the created html page.

### How to use it

List of details of the interactions developed on the page.

#### Index

The index is automatically generated with the use of `h1.index-title` and `h2` elements. When a new part is added to the library, the index will be automatically updated with links that redirected onto the correct page.

#### Tag search

A tag system search has been created to help sorting the pages where there is a lot of differents elements that can be identified by keywords. The tags available to the search will be automatically generated by the use of the `tags span` element.
